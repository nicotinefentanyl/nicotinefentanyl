        <p>freeing up time begs the question, "what do I do with the time that I've got"
            well what is there *to do?*
            there are various activities that might fill your time but why do them when you could do any of them and in general they are filling time that you've freed up, thereby filling up the time again...The point of time is not to have it for free, it is to use it wisely.
            There is a common question asked to young people "what do you want to do?" This question elucidates the point of "what is there *to do*?" What you do (for work) is what you *do*. That is how most people operate. Every morning I wake up and write a list with my daily plan. There is a point around after breakfast where I wonder, beyond the chores have been piling up for months at the bottom of said lists, what should I do? Read, some academic goal, music, ect.. All of these are simply time fillers on days off. Any one of them I could make a career of and that would be what I *do*, but as it stands, I do those sometimes. My work is what I *do*. It's the clear and truthful answer on most days. I do lighting at the Brooklyn Bowl. Most days I startup the console, check if everything works, program a bit, set a look, browse on my computer, grab a bite to eat, sit at the console during the show, and shut everything down. It's a simple and nice thing to do. I'm okay with doing that and knowing that's what I do. Beyond what I do, I have things I *like to do*. Those are the hobbies I fill my off days with when I'm doing something other than what I mostly do. </p>
